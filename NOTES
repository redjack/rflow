rflow <config file>
  figure out a work directory
  make sure that it has the right subdirectories (can be overridden)
    run tmp logs schemas components
  Set up logging to logs/rflow.log
  Load all schemas
  Verify all component installation
  Initialize components
  Start components running and make sure that they "daemonize" correctly
    - place pid files in deployment's run directory
  Configure components via zmq
  Daemonize self



class Component
  def self.input_port
  end

  def self.output_port
  end

  attr_accessor :state

  def initialize(config, run_directory)

  end

  def run

  end

  def configure

end



class PassThrough < Component
  input_port [:in]
  input_port :another_in
  output_port :out
  output_port :another_out

  def initialize(config, run_directory)
    # This will initialize the ports
    super
    # Do stuff to initialize component
  end

end


Computation Requirements:
  Initial startup with:
    - management bus connection information
    - group and instance UUID
    - beacon interval
    - run directory, containing
      - PID files
      - log dir + logs
      - computation-specific configuration (conf dir)
  Needs to process the following messages from mgmt bus:
    - CONFIGURE (ports)
    - RUN
    - SHUTDOWN
  Needs to send the following messages to mgmt bus:
    - LOG
    - BEACON (state machine of the below submessages)
      - STARTED
      - CONFIGURED
      - RUNNING
      - STOPPING
      - STOPPED
      - ERROR
  On startup:
    - listen to mgmt bus
    - publish BEACON + state to mgmt bus every (beacon interval) seconds (default to 1 sec)


External Computations:
  - Given (out-of-band) startup info (mgmt bus, UUIDs, beacon interval)
  -


RFlow
  - Will need a DB for config
    - Initial startup will need to resolve all remaining outstanding items (ports, UUIDs, etc) and store in config DB
    - MVC, Mongrel2-like?

Translate
  - Need to add <associated type="objtype" name="myname"> where name attr can be used in later XML templates






----------------
Plugins:
  an externally defined plugin needs access to all current data types, as well as being able to define its own and tell the system about that.
    - necessary to tell system?
    - need a protocol for defining schema transfer
    - each message has attached schema


lib/rflow/message.rb

RFlow::Config

RFlow::Management
  - Somewhere for external people to register new computations with running system
  - computation says that its running and asks for Connection configuration
    - how will it specify where in the workflow it wants to run????

RFlow::Message(complete on-the-wire Avro message format)
  data_type, provenance, external_ids, empty, data (see below)

RFlow::Data::(various message data blocks)

RFlow::Computation
  uuid, name, class, input_ports, output_ports


RFlow::Connection
  encapsulates link knowlege and provides an API for sending and receiving
  each computation will have one for each port
  each computation will call into the connection to send (possibly via a Port object) and recieve

RFlow::Connection::AMQP
  will manage connections to an AMQP server

RFlow::Connection::ZMQ




computation_a.output_port -> (connection.incoming -> connection.outgoing) -> computation_b.input_port

AMQP::Topic - responsible for setting up a topic -> queue binding
  r.incoming = amqp connection, channel, vhost, login, password, topic
  r.outgoing = amqp connection, channel, vhost, login, password, queue name
  behavior -> n x m, "round-robin" among the connected outgoing
    incoming behavior will need to set topic/key, uses the data type in the RFlow::Message


ZMQ::PubSub - device-less, responsible for assigning ip/port and assigning one client to bind the port
  r.incoming = zmq connection string (tcp://ip:port), type pub
  r.outgoing = zmq connection string (tcp://ip:port), type sub
  behavior -> n x m, broadcast sending,

ZMQ::PushPull - device-less, responsible for assigning ip/port and assigning one client to bind the port
  r.incoming = zmq connection string (tcp://ip:port), type push
  r.outgoing = zmq connection string (tcp://ip:port), type pull


Startup

RFlow.run is the management process for the workflow

computations = config.computations.map do |c|
  instantiate_computation(c)
  # Check for errors here, which would be evident if a computation couldn't be found/created
  # Just creating single process ruby objects here to check for errors
end

computations.each do |c|
  c.configure # with what????
  # Still single ruby process to set and deconflict all the configuration parameters
end

computations.each do |c|
  c.run
end
